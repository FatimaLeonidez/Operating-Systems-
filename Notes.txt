We must combine the scheduling code with the Auth codes, as well as virtual memory.

Ideas for virtual memory:
Would you like to write a short message in a txt file? Y/N

If yes, write a short 5 word message: _____.
  Would you like to save the txt file in virtual memory? Y/N
    If yes, your file will take up 10KB of memory. Proceed? Y/N
      If yes, txt file saved! Would you like to write another?
If no, would you like to log out? Y/N

Should access to previously stored files be included?
Would this require statements detailing how that data is retrieved from the memory?
