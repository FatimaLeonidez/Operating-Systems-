<h1> Project Title: Creating a Basic OS </h1>
<em>Created by: Cecilia Duran, Fatima Leonidez, and Alejandra Rodriguez</em>

<h2>Project description:</h2> 
The following project is meant to demonstrate a simplified operating system. The functionalities of this simplified operating system include booting up the computer, prompting the user to log in or sign up, allowing the user to create a new account, permitting the user to log in after that new account has been created, and exiting the program. All in all, the program is made to mimic how an actual computer starts and operates.

<h2>Instructions for setting up and running the initial program:</h2> 
<p>This project can be run in vscode or visual studios with the correct compilers downloaded. Web compilers are not recommended since they may only allowed one file at a time. <br />
  
There are three files needed to run this program: auth.h, auth.cpp, and OS project1_main.cpp. Once all three files are open on a compiler such as Visual Studio, the program can be executed. A series of lines of text will appear upon execution, prompting the user to enter strings of characters. These strings will represent the options to "log in" or "sign up", the username, or the password. In this manner, we have created a basic operating system capable of authenticating a unique user. </p>
