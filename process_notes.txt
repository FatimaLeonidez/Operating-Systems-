Pid1 = Arrival_time(), Burst_time()
Pid2 = Arrival_time(), Burst_time()
Pid3 = Arrival_time(), Burst_time()

We're doing First Come First Serve (FCFS).
For FCFS, priority is given to the one that appears first (No need to consider burst time here).

Waiting_time(formula) = tba
Turnaround_time(formula) = completion_time - Arrival_time
