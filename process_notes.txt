We're doing First Come First Serve (FCFS).
For FCFS, priority is given to the one that appears first (No need to consider burst time here).

Waiting_time(formula) = tba
Turnaround_time(formula) = completion_time - Arrival_time

New = Fetus (can't walk)
Ready = Arrival (in queue) (first steps? waddling?) 
Running = On Gantt chart (execution)
Waiting = (maybe) if no termination condition
Terminated = end

waiting_time = arrival(or running) - running
remaining_time = running to terminated

		ales idea numero dos: 
		[NEW] Process 1: (pid: ##); Arrival Time: 0; CPU Burst Time: 3
		... (new to ready)
